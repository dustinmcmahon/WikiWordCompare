# WikiWordCompare
System to find similar articles based on word usage 

## Requirements
[Project 1](https://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/csc365/a1.html)

This assignment asks you to create a similarity-based web-site recommendation system based on Wikipedia pages.
- The program reads 10 (or more) Wikipedia pages. The urls for these web pages can be maintained in a control file that is read when the program starts. Use a framwwork such as JSoup to extract text bodies etc from html.
- Establish a similarity metric, that must include information based on custom frequency tables (as will be discussed in class), possibly weighted by or in conjunction with other attributes.
- Create a user interface that allows a user to indicate one topic or site, and displays two similar ones. The presentation details are up to you. It may be a web/browser-based (for example Spring) or GUI base (Swing, JavaFX, or Android) for the GUI. For Swing, read through the relevant parts of the Swing tutorial first.
- Use appropriate existing libraries for every component other than the custom similarity tracking.

Test your program thoroughly before submitting, and arrange a demo within 48 hours of submitting. (Demoing before submitting is strongly encouraged.)
